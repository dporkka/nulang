# Contributing to Nulang

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Nulang is pre-1.0 alpha software —
expect rough edges, and expect breaking changes before v1.0.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dporkka/nulang.git
cd nulang
cargo build --release
```

Requires Rust 1.95.0 (pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`), Linux or macOS.
Windows is unsupported; use WSL.

## Run the tests

```bash
cargo test                                          # full test suite
cargo test --features wasm-backend                  # WASM backend suite
./conformance/run.py                                # behavioral conformance suite
NULANG_BIN=./target/release/nulang bash scripts/verify_doc_examples.sh  # doc snippets
```

Please make sure these pass before opening a PR. CI runs them all.

## Commit style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, etc., with a short
imperative summary. PR titles are checked by CI.

## Stability tiers

Every public surface is Frozen, Stable, or Experimental (see
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)). Bug fixes and Experimental features don't
need an RFC; changes to Frozen or Stable surfaces do — see
`RFC/0000-template.md`. Record every user-visible change in `CHANGELOG.md`
under the correct tier.
